# Iterators

To implement iteration functionality for user-defined type, it has to implement 
`Iterable` interface.


User-created `class` that implements `Iterable` interface. Function iterator, returns
an `Iterator` object, which we have to define specifically for the `MyArray` `class`.


`MyArrayIter` inherits from the abstract `Iterator` `class`, and has to implement 
method `next()`.



Here we have for extended for-loops over our `class` `MyArray`. It is only possible
because it implements the `Iterable` interface. We do not have to traverse it in order,
we can get creative with the `MyArrayIter` `class`.
